        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>DrowzyKnight is a safety-focused application designed to monitor drivers’ alertness and provide real-time feedback to prevent accidents caused by drowsiness. It combines facial recognition, eye-tracking, and AI algorithms to detect signs of fatigue and issue timely warnings. The platform can also generate reports for fleet managers to analyze driver behavior and enhance overall safety.</p>

        <h3>Motivation Behind DrowzyKnight</h3>
        <p>While working with transport and logistics teams, I noticed a recurring problem: driver fatigue was a major cause of accidents. Many drivers struggled with maintaining alertness on long trips, and existing solutions were either too expensive or intrusive. I wanted to create an affordable, reliable solution that could monitor alertness without being disruptive. DrowzyKnight was born to save lives, improve driver productivity, and give fleet managers actionable insights.</p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>👀 Real-time eye-tracking to detect drowsiness</li>
          <li>🔔 Audible and visual alerts when fatigue is detected</li>
          <li>📊 Daily and weekly driver reports for analysis</li>
          <li>🧠 AI-powered behavior prediction to anticipate fatigue</li>
          <li>📱 Mobile-friendly interface for easy monitoring</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>⚡ Python and OpenCV for real-time video processing</li>
          <li>🧠 TensorFlow for fatigue detection and predictive analytics</li>
          <li>📱 React Native for mobile dashboard and alerts</li>
          <li>💾 SQLite and cloud storage for logs and reporting</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges & Solutions</h3>
        <p>One of the main challenges was achieving accurate real-time detection without heavy computational requirements. Initially, the system had latency issues, but by optimizing the neural network and using lightweight models, I improved performance. Another challenge was designing alerts that were noticeable but not distracting. I iterated through multiple sound tones and visual indicators to find a balance that ensured safety.</p>

        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>This project reinforced my understanding of AI in real-world applications. I gained deep insights into computer vision, neural networks, and system optimization. I also learned the importance of human-centered design: even the best AI system fails if users find it intrusive or hard to use.</p>

        <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
        <p>Future plans include integrating wearable devices for biometric monitoring, adding speech-based alerts, and expanding predictive analytics to forecast fatigue trends over long-term data. The goal is to make DrowzyKnight a comprehensive safety suite for drivers everywhere.</p>
