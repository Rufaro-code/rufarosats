        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Accessible App is a React-based platform that empowers users with accessibility challenges to navigate and interact with digital content effortlessly. It incorporates voice commands, screen reader optimizations, and keyboard navigation to create a truly inclusive experience. Users can perform actions, explore content, and engage with features without relying solely on visual interfaces.</p>

        <h3>Motivation Behind Accessible App</h3>
        <p>The motivation stemmed from a personal observation: many web apps prioritize aesthetics and advanced features but overlook accessibility. I wanted to design an app that removes barriers for users with disabilities, ensuring digital inclusivity. This project was inspired by the belief that technology should serve everyone, regardless of physical ability.</p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>🗣️ Voice navigation for hands-free interaction</li>
          <li>🎛️ Keyboard-friendly controls for full navigation</li>
          <li>🔊 Screen reader support for visually impaired users</li>
          <li>📦 Modular React components for easy integration</li>
          <li>🌙 Dark and light mode toggle for visual comfort</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>⚛️ React with Hooks and Context API</li>
          <li>🗣️ Web Speech API for voice recognition and synthesis</li>
          <li>🎨 Tailwind CSS for responsive design</li>
          <li>💾 LocalStorage for saving user preferences</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges & Solutions</h3>
        <p>One challenge was ensuring accurate voice recognition in noisy environments. I implemented filtering techniques and tested across multiple devices. Another challenge was balancing accessibility features with a clean UI. Iterative user testing with real accessibility tool users helped refine the experience.</p>

        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>Building this app strengthened my understanding of inclusive design principles, Web Speech API, and responsive accessibility. I learned how thoughtful UI/UX decisions can profoundly impact usability for all users.</p>

        <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
        <p>Future versions will include multilingual voice commands, AI-assisted navigation suggestions, and integration with assistive devices to extend accessibility further.</p>
