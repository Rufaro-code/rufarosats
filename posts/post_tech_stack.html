    <h2 class="section-title">ðŸ’» My Favorite Tech Stack</h2>
    <p>
      Over the years, Iâ€™ve experimented with various tools, languages, and frameworks to find a combination that allows me to develop projects efficiently, maintain code quality, and quickly iterate on ideas. Today, I want to share my favorite tech stack and explain why each component is integral to my workflow.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Frontend: React, React Native, Flutter</h3>
    <p>
      For web applications, I rely on <strong>React</strong> because of its component-based architecture, speed, and flexibility. It allows me to break complex UIs into reusable components and manage state effectively. Reactâ€™s rich ecosystem and libraries, such as Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion, also enhance my productivity by simplifying styling and animations.
    </p>
    <p>
      For mobile apps, I use <strong>React Native</strong> for cross-platform development. It enables me to maintain a single codebase for both Android and iOS while still achieving near-native performance. For projects that require more intensive UI customization or animation, I occasionally use <strong>Flutter</strong>, which allows me to build highly responsive and visually appealing applications.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Backend: Node.js, Express, Spring Boot</h3>
    <p>
      On the backend, I prefer <strong>Node.js</strong> for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture. Itâ€™s perfect for building scalable APIs and real-time applications, such as chat apps or dashboards. Paired with <strong>Express</strong>, I can quickly set up RESTful APIs and integrate middleware for authentication, logging, and security.
    </p>
    <p>
      For enterprise-level or complex backend systems, I use <strong>Java with Spring Boot</strong>. Spring Boot provides a robust framework for building reliable, maintainable, and secure applications. It simplifies dependency management, allows rapid prototyping, and has excellent integration with databases, messaging systems, and cloud platforms.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Database Systems: PostgreSQL, MongoDB</h3>
    <p>
      For structured relational data, I use <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>. Itâ€™s powerful, open-source, and supports advanced features like indexing, triggers, and JSON data types. PostgreSQL ensures my applications have strong data integrity and allows me to write complex queries efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      For projects requiring flexible schema or handling large volumes of unstructured data, I opt for <strong>MongoDB</strong>. Its document-based model works well with JSON and allows me to iterate rapidly without worrying about schema migrations. Combining both databases depending on the use case gives me the best of both worlds.
    </p>

    <h3>4. APIs & Integration</h3>
    <p>
      APIs are at the heart of modern applications. I regularly integrate third-party services such as OpenAI APIs for AI functionality, payment gateways, SMS/USSD services, and cloud storage. For internal APIs, I follow REST principles, sometimes incorporating GraphQL when clients need more flexible queries. Automated API generation tools help me save time and reduce boilerplate code.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Automation & Scripting: Python</h3>
    <p>
      I love Python for automating repetitive tasks and handling data. From web scraping and batch processing to AI-powered scripts, Pythonâ€™s simplicity and rich library ecosystem (like Selenium, Pandas, and OpenAI SDKs) make it my go-to scripting language. Automation saves me hours, improves accuracy, and ensures that workflows are consistent across projects.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Version Control: Git & GitHub</h3>
    <p>
      No project is complete without version control. I use <strong>Git</strong> extensively for tracking changes, collaborating with others, and managing multiple branches. GitHub serves as my central repository for project code, documentation, and issue tracking. Proper use of version control keeps projects organized and enables smooth teamwork.
    </p>

    <h3>7. DevOps & Deployment</h3>
    <p>
      Deploying projects efficiently is critical. I use <strong>Vercel</strong> and <strong>Netlify</strong> for frontend deployments, while backend services often go on <strong>Heroku</strong>, <strong>AWS</strong>, or <strong>DigitalOcean</strong>. Continuous integration pipelines automate testing and deployment, ensuring that updates reach users without downtime.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Motivation Behind My Stack</h3>
    <p>
      Choosing a tech stack is never arbitrary. My goal is to balance speed, maintainability, scalability, and performance. React and Node.js allow fast iteration for client-facing apps. Java Spring Boot and PostgreSQL offer reliability for more complex backend systems. Python enables automation, while Git ensures version control discipline. Together, these tools make me productive, allow me to deliver high-quality projects, and adapt to new challenges efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also consider community support, documentation, and long-term viability when picking technologies. Being able to quickly solve problems and learn from existing resources keeps development smooth and prevents frustrating dead-ends.
    </p>

    <h3>9. Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      This tech stack represents a combination of flexibility, reliability, and efficiency. It allows me to build full-stack applications, mobile apps, automated tools, and integrations with ease. It evolves as I experiment with new frameworks and libraries, but the core principles of productivity, maintainability, and scalability remain constant. By carefully selecting the right tools for each problem, I can focus on building meaningful, high-quality projects rather than fighting the technology.
